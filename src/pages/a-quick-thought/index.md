title: A Quick Thought On Remote Work

I saw a tweet today pointing out that when you say "hire the best", it often excludes hiring remote hires.

I've been working remotely for nearly four years and I have to say that there are tons of caveats to working remotely but they all boil down to the fact that it's still not a 100% widespread policy across tech companies.

We've had some first-time remote hires and what's really fascinating is that they embraced it almost right away and none of those "caveats" applied to them. So when someone says they're not "cut out" for it or they're not "used to it", I only tell them that just as with everything else, practices makes perfect.

All it takes is time and energy and a good setup. The upside of remote work cannot be ignored, namely that the "best" is not constrained to a ten mile radius of the company headquarters.

On top of that, once you get used to remote work, I found that communication actually improves. People get used to oversharing and information does not get "trapped" within just a few individuals that work close to each other.
